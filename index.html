                <div class="thumbnail-center">Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[3][4][5][6] Bryant won five NBA championships, and was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.</div><br>

                    <h3>Kobe Time line</h3>
                    <p>Kobe Bryant, the son of NBA player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant, was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On January 26, 2020 he perished in a tragic helicopter accident that the world will be struggling to process for a long, long time. In the 41 years between these events, however, he lived a life like no other, and his ups and downs were just like the man himself: larger than life. From his meteoric ascension into the NBA as a bold youth to his departure as one of the league's greatest players of all time — let's take a look at the timeline of Kobe Bryant's career.</p>
